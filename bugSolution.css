The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with classes containing pseudo-element selectors. Instead, apply these styles directly using standard CSS rules.

```tailwindcss
/* bugSolution.css */
.my-custom-class {
  /* ... other styles ... */
}
.my-custom-class::before {
  content: "Some Text";
  background-color: blue;
}

<div class="my-custom-class"></div>
```

This approach ensures that the styles are applied correctly to the pseudo-element without interference from the `@apply` directive.
