This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-element selector (e.g., `::before`, `::after`).  The `@apply` directive doesn't properly handle these selectors and can lead to unexpected behavior or styling issues.

For example:

```tailwindcss
@layer utilities {
  .my-custom-class::before {
    content: "Some Text";
    background-color: blue;
  }
}

<div class="my-custom-class"></div>
```

If you try to apply this class using `@apply` in another class or style rule, it likely won't work as expected, or might cause unexpected style changes in other parts of the app.
